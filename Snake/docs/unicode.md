# Part 3 Unicode

### 1. Who founded the Consortium? Who is represented among the current members, and how might that affect decisions being made for Unicode?

Joe Becker, Lee Collins, and Mark Davis founded Consortium. The largest of the current member includes Adobe, Airbnb, Apple, Google, Meta, Micorsoft, and Netflix. I believe the consortium being ran mostly by major corporations takes away power from the people, especially for languages and other culturally important symbols that are not respresented in the current Unicode.



### 2. Find a language that is not yet in Unicode, has only recently been supported (e.g., in the last 10 years), or is/was missing important characters. What is/was missing, and how does this affect the users of the language?

Dongba(China) is not supported by unicode. This group of people has a population of around 300,000, and employ a beautiful pictographic writing system. The entire langauge is not supported, meaning their voices may not be heard on a global scale as there is no way for them to send out their language digitally to machines that often only read ASCII or UNICODE. This is true of any language not supported or not fully supported by UNICODE, it is possible they may lose part of their voice while the Consortium is busy approving emojis.



### 3. For this question, you will need to work with a classmate! Make sure to coordinate so that you outline opposing positions for Part A (e.g. if you outline the ‘for’ position, your partner defends the ‘against’ position). Then, come together and discuss Part B!




#### Step A: Outline either the position for or against Han Unification

I am against Han Unification as the push for efficiency and reduced redundancy is outweighed by the culture disrespect towards these asain cultures. One example is studying, 學 in traditional Chinese versus 学 in simplified Chinese. Chinese people may find the lack of depth to the new artwork takes away from the meaning of the original character.



#### Step B
### A bullet-point summary of your discussion for Step B

- The symbols still have the same roots and usages.
- Could make the understanding of their language by others easier, amplifying the voices of asain cultures.
- Was not done to be disrespectful towards these cultures.


#### Describe the tradeoff that Unicode has made with this decision 

- Unicode gave up the increased workload for rendering mechanisms that are renderin essentially the same character but in much different artistic styles, while giving up regional specificity and expression by remove said artistic styles.
