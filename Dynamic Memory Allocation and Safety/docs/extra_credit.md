EXTRA CREDIT DONE: Created my own test

- I noticed a vulnerability in the program where a user could change the size of the metadata and wreak havoc on error logic and the ability to cause numerous segfaults. The program should not rely on a non const metadata in order to find the size of an allocated block. To show that I implemented a fix to this problem, I ensured my testEXTRA.cc passes with the correct statistics, meaning I did not rely on the maliciously changed data. Without this, we can still pass all tests but we leave ourselves vulnerable to faulty test outputs and a segfault, opening up the door to non-deterministic behavior and potentially dangerous security consequences. Furthermore, simply setting the size_t ptr to a constant or just setting a constant ptr when allocating the size in the metadata, means that while we are protected against overwrites at compile time, we could still suffer overwrites during run-time as the memory simply does not exist in a ROM location.
